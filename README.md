#### What is cub3d?
This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which
was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which youâ€™ll have to find your way.

#### Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/s-sergiu/cub3D.git

```
Choose one of the valid maps in the data/maps folder, Here is an example to use a valid map
